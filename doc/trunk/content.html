<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Graph3 adds a 3D grapher and a differential equation grapher to your TI-83+, TI-83+ Silver
Edition, TI-84+ or TI-84+ Silver Edition.&nbsp;The 3D grapher is faster than the TI-89’s 
built-in grapher.&nbsp; It features rotation, zooming, tracing, and more.&nbsp; It also 
draws either wireframe or hidden surface plots.
The differential equation grapher features the Runge-Kutta method, slope fields and more.</p>

<h1>Installation</h1>

<p>Send the "graph3.8xk" file to your calculator
using a graph link. You must have a
link; applications cannot be typed in by hand.</p>

<p>To install, press [APPS] and then select "Graph3"
from the list. A message box will popup, instructing you on how to
proceed. (If you have other graphing applications installed, for
example, Inequality or Transformation graphing, you will be
asked to uninstall them.)</p>

<h1>Compatibility</h1>

<p>Graph3 is not compatible with programs such as Inequality
Graphing or Transformation Graphing. If
you have these applications installed, Graph3 will request that you uninstall
them in order to proceed. Graph3 may be
installed at the same time as Symbolic and Omnicalc. <i>However</i>, for
compatibilty reasons, it does not allow you to enter
their tokens into the Z= equation.</p>

<!--
<table><tr>
  <td valign=top><b>IMPORTANT:&nbsp;</b></td>
  <td>If you have a previous version installed, upon running the new "Graph3"
  you will be asked to uninstall the old version. Run the old version to uninstall
  it, then delete it from your calculator. Also delete the corresponding APPVAR.
  This solves connectivity issues with the USB cable and newer versions of TI Connect.</td>

<h1>Functionality</h1>

<p>To enter the graphing modes, press [Y=] twice. A menu will popup where you
can choose to enter Differential Equation or 3D graphing mode. You will remain
in the selected mode until you push a key that exits graph mode (examples: [2nd]QUIT,
program editor, memory check, etc). Graphing is very similar to the
normal function graphing on the 83+, with the following differences:</p>

<h3>3D Mode</h3>
<ul type=disc>
 <li>There are only two graph styles: wireframe (thin line) and hidden surface
     (filled triangle).</li>
 <li>[X,T,theta,n] inserts X as usual, but [STAT] inserts Y.</li>
 <li>Only three zooming options are available. Also, the cursor for zoom in and
     zoom out point selection is the same as the trace cursor to increase
     visibility.</li>
 <li>The Format menu has less options. Also, selecting PolarGC in 3D mode is the
     equivalent of a cylindrical coordinate system.</li>
 <li>[2nd]Stat Plot, [2nd]TblSet, [2nd]Calc, and [2nd]Table are not available in
     3D mode.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are also the following additional features:</p>

<ul type=disc>
 <li>When viewing a graph (no cursor), push [GRAPH] again to instantly toggle the
     graph type between wireframe and hidden surface.</li>
 <li>Whenever viewing a graph, press [ALPHA]X, [ALPHA]Y, or [ALPHA]Z to view the
     graph from that axis.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Differential Equation mode</h3>
The format screen has the following new options:
<ul type=circle>
  <li><b>Euler/RungeKutta:</b> Selects the solution method of the differential equation. You can choose between the faster Euler method or the more precise RungeKutta method.</li>
   <li><b>Field:</b> Controls whether a slopefield of the equation is displayed. When the slopefield is on, graphing multiple equations or a system of equations will give an ERR:INVALID error.</li>
</ul>
The window screen has the following new variables:
<ul type=circle>
  <li><b>Diftol:</b> Sets the tolerance for the RungeKutta method, which is used to select a stepsize for the RungeKutta algorithm. This variable is only visible when RungeKutta mode is selected.</li>
   <li><b>Fldres:</b> Sets the number of columns (1 to 48) that are used to draw a slopefield. This value is only visible when the slopefield is enabled.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Uninstallation</h1>

<p>To uninstall, simply run the application again (from the [APPS] menu). It
should display a message indicating that it has been installed.</p>

<table><tr>
 <td valign=top><b>IMPORTANT:&nbsp;</b></td>
 <td>Some applications will offer to uninstall Graph3. This will probably
  work, but it would be better to uninstall it yourself.</td>

<h1>Version History</h1>

<table>
<tr>
 <td valign=top><b>v1.9&nbsp;</b></td>
 <td>Differential Equation support added by Martin Warmer, done as a project for the Google Summer of Code. License changed to MIT License.</td>
</tr>	
<tr>
 <td valign=top><b>v1.1&nbsp;</b></td>
 <td>The application's name has been changed to "Graph3" to fix compatibility problems with the TI-84. Source code is also included with this version.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td valign=top><b>v1.0&nbsp;</b></td>
 <td>Many bugs fixed, including compatibility problems with OS version 1.13.
 Tracing problem also fixed. Added a few minor features
 and another easter egg (yes, there are two now).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td valign=top><b>v0.9&nbsp;</b></td>
 <td>Initial release.</td>
</tr>

<br>

<h1>Known Issues</h1>

<h3>3D Mode</h3>
<ul type=disc>
 <li>Cannot use [2nd]Calc to enter abstract coordinates in trace mode</li>
 <li>[2nd]Left and [2nd]Right do nothing when viewing/tracing the graph</li>
</ul>

<h3>Differential Equation Mode</h3>
<ul type=disc> <li>Recalling Y1 inserts Real(34,0 in the equation instead of the contents of Y1&#39;.</li>
 <li>When entering Y1(3) for example, the (3) part is ignored when graphing, but used when calculating the table. This can cause the calculator to never finish calculating the table or display different results for the table that are different from the graph.</li>
 <li>Entering X in an equation will give an error when graphing, but when calculating the table it won't give an error; instead it will behave like you entered T.</li>
</ul>
