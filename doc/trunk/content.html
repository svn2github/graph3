<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Graph3 is a 3D grapher for your TI-83+ or TI-83+ Silver Edition.&nbsp; It is
faster than the TI-89’s built-in grapher.&nbsp; It features rotation, zooming,
tracing, and more.&nbsp; It also draws either wireframe or hidden surface
plots.</p>

<h1>Installation</h1>

<p>Send the "graph3.8xk" file to your calculator
using a graph link. You must have a
link; applications cannot be typed in by hand.</p>

<p>To install, press [APPS] and then select "Graph3"
from the list. A message box will popup, instructing you on how to
proceed. (If you have other graphing applications installed, for
example, Inequality or Transformation graphing, you will be
asked to uninstall them.)</p>

<table><tr>
  <td valign=top><b>IMPORTANT:&nbsp;</b></td>
  <td>If you have a previous version installed, upon running the new "Graph3"
  you will be asked to uninstall the old version. Run the old version to uninstall
  it, then delete it from your calculator. Also delete the corresponding APPVAR.
  This solves connectivity issues with the USB cable and newer versions of TI Connect.</td>
</tr></table>

<h1>Functionality</h1>

<p>To enter 3D mode, press [Y=] twice. You will remain
in 3D mode until you push a key that exits graph mode (examples: [2nd]QUIT,
program editor, memory check, etc). Graphing is very similar to the
normal function graphing on the 83+, with the following differences:</p>

<ul type=disc>
 <li>There are only two graph styles: wireframe (thin line) and hidden surface
     (filled triangle).</li>
 <li>[X,T,theta,n] inserts X as usual, but [STAT] inserts Y.</li>
 <li>Only three zooming options are available. Also, the cursor for zoom in and
     zoom out point selection is the same as the trace cursor to increase
     visibility.</li>
 <li>The Format menu has less options. Also, selecting PolarGC in 3D mode is the
     equivalent of a cylindrical coordinate system.</li>
 <li>[2nd]Stat Plot, [2nd]TblSet, [2nd]Calc, and [2nd]Table are not available in
     3D mode.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are also the following additional features:</p>

<ul type=disc>
 <li>When viewing a graph (no cursor), push [GRAPH] again to instantly toggle the
     graph type between wireframe and hidden surface.</li>
 <li>Whenever viewing a graph, press [ALPHA]X, [ALPHA]Y, or [ALPHA]Z to view the
     graph from that axis.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Uninstallation</h1>

<p>To uninstall, simply run the application again (from the [APPS] menu). It
should display a message indicating that it has been installed.</p>

<table><tr>
 <td valign=top><b>IMPORTANT:&nbsp;</b></td>
 <td>Some applications will offer to uninstall Graph3. This will probably
  work, but it would be better to uninstall it yourself.</td>
</tr></table>

<h1>Version History</h1>

<table>
<tr>
 <td valign=top><b>v1.1&nbsp;</b></td>
 <td>The application's name has been changed to "Graph3" to fix compatibility problems with the TI-84. Source code is also included with this version.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td valign=top><b>v1.0&nbsp;</b></td>
 <td>Many bugs fixed, including compatibility problems with OS version 1.13.
 Tracing problem also fixed. Added a few minor features
 and another easter egg (yes, there are two now).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td valign=top><b>v0.9&nbsp;</b></td>
 <td>Initial release.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<br>

<h1>Compatibility</h1>

<p>Graph3 is not compatible with programs such as Inequality
Graphing or Transformation Graphing. If
you have these applications installed, Graph3 will request that you uninstall
them in order to proceed. Graph3 may be
installed at the same time as Symbolic and Omnicalc. <i>However</i>, for
compatibilty reasons, it does not allow you to enter
their tokens into the Z= equation.</p>

<h1>Known Issues</h1>

<ul type=disc>
 <li>Cannot use [2nd]Calc to enter abstract coordinates in trace mode</li>
 <li>[2nd]Left and [2nd]Right do nothing when viewing/tracing the graph</li>
</ul>
